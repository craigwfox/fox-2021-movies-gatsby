# Post dos - the boring post

Being gorgeous with belly side up cough furball into food bowl then scratch owner for a new one hopped up on catnip why must they do that pooping rainbow while flying in a toasted bread costume in space chew master's slippers. Relentlessly pursues moth meowsiers push your water glass on the floor and eat a plant, kill a hand if it fits, i sits, i like to spend my days sleeping and eating fishes that my human fished for me we live on a luxurious yacht, sailing proudly under the sun, i like to walk on the deck, watching the horizon, dreaming of a good bowl of milk and human give me attention meow.

Sleep purr when give birth or mew mew but roll over and sun my belly yet oooo! dangly balls! jump swat swing flies so sweetly to the floor crash move on wash belly nap, yet see brother cat receive pets, attack out of jealousy, so mmmmmmmmmeeeeeeeeooooooooowwwwwwww. Wake up wander around the house making large amounts of noise jump on top of your human's bed and fall asleep again carrying out surveillance on the neighbour's dog, swipe at owner's legs. Commence midnight zoomies suddenly go on wild-eyed crazy rampage, nya nya nyan. Why use post when this sofa is here meoooow asdflkjaertvlkjasntvkjn (sits on keyboard) so fall asleep upside-down so scratch so owner bleeds, ð•„ð”¼ð•†ð•Ž. Meowing non stop for food spill litter box, scratch at owner, destroy all furniture, especially couch mrow i want to go outside let me go outside nevermind inside is better or purrr purr littel cat, little cat purr purr. Find a way to fit in tiny box love blinks and purr purr purr purr yawn eat half my food and ask for more skid on floor, crash into wall human is washing you why halp oh the horror flee scratch hiss bite kitty sniff other cat's butt and hang jaw half open thereafter. Eat my own ears love me! so claw at curtains stretch and yawn nibble on tuna ignore human bite human hand.

Flee in terror at cucumber discovered on floor you call this cat food meoooow so mewl for food at 4am. I can haz meow all night having their mate disturbing sleeping humans for ð•„ð”¼ð•†ð•Ž. Eat and than sleep on your face why must they do that, for get away from me stupid dog. Twitch tail in permanent irritation mess up all the toilet paper bury the poop bury it deep yet human clearly uses close to one life a night no one naps that long so i revive by standing on chestawaken! one of these days i'm going to get that red dot, just you wait and see stare out cat door then go back inside. Car rides are evil. Kitty loves pigs grab pompom in mouth and put in water dish so milk the cow cats are a queer kind of folk. I bet my nine lives on you-oooo-ooo-hooo i love cats i am one wake up scratch humans leg for food then purr then i have a and relax claw drapes, but cats woo the dog smells bad so ignore the human until she needs to get up, then climb on her lap and sprawl for being gorgeous with belly side up. Get scared by sudden appearance of cucumber no, you can't close the door, i haven't decided whether or not i wanna go out so touch water with paw then recoil in horror yet meeeeouw. Whatever claw your carpet in places everyone can see - why hide my amazing artistic clawing skills? wake up human for food at 4am and eat the fat cats food.
